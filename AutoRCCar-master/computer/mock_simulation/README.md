This folder contains the work for a mock simulation of the full project. Essentially what it does is it creates
an 8x8 2D array that represents the wooden boards in our project. The grid is filled with 0s to intialize the grid
and we put a virutal car on the grid represented by the number 1 and a virtual destination coordinate which is
represented by the number 2. The boundaries that the car isn't allowed to drive on are represented with the number 3
and the planned navigated route of the car to the destination is represented with the number 4. As of now, this is a
single car system and in a two car system, additional numbers would be added to represent car 2, it's destination,
as well as it's pathing.
